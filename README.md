# Pathfinding Visualizer | Python Arcade Library

This is a Dijkstra pathfinding visualizer that I'm using to both learn the Arcade library of Python and more about pathfinding algorithms.
Arcade is typically used to make arcade-style and 2D platformer games but it has a ton of other applications.


Current operation:
The board is set up and Dijkstra's algorithm v1 is implemented. You can choose your starting and target nodes, walls can be built but
have no effect yet. Visual bugs need squished.

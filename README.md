# Pathfinding Visualizer | Python Arcade Library

This is a WIP pathfinding visualizer that I'm using to both learn the Arcade library of Python and more about pathfinding algorithms.
Arcade is typically used to make arcade-style and 2D platformer games but it has a ton of other applications.


Current operation:
The board is set up and applicable. Development on Djikstras' algorithm will begin after the window is fully set up. Arcade Views are needing to be built and pieced together for an instruction/info pane.

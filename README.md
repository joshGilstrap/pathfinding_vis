# Pathfinding Visualizer | Python Arcade Library

This is a Dijkstra pathfinding visualizer that I'm using to both learn the Arcade library of Python and more about pathfinding algorithms.
Arcade is typically used to make arcade-style and 2D platformer games but it has a ton of other applications.


# Current operation:  
Dijkstra's algorithm is fully implemented. A* algorithm under construction. Currently is just an addition of Euclidean distance and 
a total distance heuristic

# A* example:

# Pathfinding Visualizer | Python Arcade Library

This is a Dijkstra pathfinding visualizer that I'm using to both learn the Arcade library of Python and more about pathfinding algorithms.
Arcade is typically used to make arcade-style and 2D platformer games but it has a ton of other applications.


Current operation:
Dijkstra's algorithm is fully implemented. Walls are obstructive, a path is recorded and drawn. I'll call this officially v1.0. Still needs quite
a few cosmetics and tests
